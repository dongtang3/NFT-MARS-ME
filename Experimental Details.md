## Data sets 
We conducted experiments on four real-world NFT transaction datasets BAYC, Cool Cats, Doodles, and Meebits. To secure a sufficient number of test sets, 40\% of interactions from each user were randomly selected and used as a test set. As a result, the historical user-item interactions for each collection are split into 62\% training and 38\% testing on average, which are then equally and randomly divided into validation and test sets. 
We performed negative sampling to create user-specific pairwise preferences, designating user-purchased items as positive and selecting five negative samples for each positive sample based on popularity.Splitting)<br>
